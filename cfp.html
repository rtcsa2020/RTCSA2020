            <p>RTCSA 2020 is going to be held in Hangzhou, China. The RTCSA conference series carry on with the tradition and bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry for advancing the technology of embedded and real-time systems and their emerging applications, including the Internet of things and cyber-physical systems.</p>
            <p>RTCSA seeks both research and industry track papers that describe research or technical aspects in the area of embedded and real-time systems. Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society.</p>
            <p>Submission of a paper should be regarded as a commitment that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference to present the work. RTCSA2020 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p>

            <h3>Scope</h3>
            <p>The 25th edition of RTCSA will bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry to promote cross-fertilization and discuss advances and trends in the technology of embedded and real-time systems and their emerging applications, including the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. RTCSA 2020 seeks papers that describe original research in these areas, particularly in:</p>

	    <h3>Paper Submission (<a href="#">Submission Site</a>)</h3>
            <p>Both research and industry track papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. We welcome high quality papers, either in Full Paper format (the main body of each submitted paper is limited to 10 pages in the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-columns, single-space, 10pt), with additional pages permitted for the bibliography and acknowledgments only) or Short Paper format (max 6 pages). In some cases, the PC may decide to accept a long submitted paper as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version. Conference content will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore.&nbsp;The prospective authors should submit their papers through the submission web page.</p>
