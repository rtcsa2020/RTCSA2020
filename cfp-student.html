            <p><b>Virtual Conference Format</b></p>
            <p>We are currently evaluating many factors and reviewing best practices to determine the optimal format for the various sessions that are scheduled at RTCSA 2020. We will be making a relevant announcement as soon as these details are finalized. We hope you all stay safe and well, and look forward to working with you all to put on an exciting virtual RTCSA.</p>
